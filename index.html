        Overview 
    </h2>
    <p>
        <blockquote>
            <b>
        Hybrid sports cars are increasingly common thanks to electricity's performance-enhancing qualities, but the 2020 BMW i8 is more about looking fast than going fast. Still, the BMW provides a show-stopping entrance regardless of whether its dihedral doors open on the hardtop coupe or convertible roadster. While its plug-in powertrain is respectably powerful—and quicker than lesser hybrids—you're more likely to see one tear around a Whole Foods parking lot than your local racetrack. A user-friendly ride and comfortable front seats make the 2020 i8 usable every day; however, its limited storage space and compromised cabin access might cross it off most people's list.

    What's New for 2021
</h3>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>
            After earning a subtle makeover for 2019, which included updated battery technology and the addition of the convertible roadster, the 2020 i8 lineup carries over unchanged.

    Engine, Transmission, and Performance
</h4>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>
            BMW offers a single powertrain in the i8. It mates a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder gas engine with an 11.6-kWh battery pack and two electric motors. The trio of power sources combines for a total of 369 horsepower, capable of driving all four wheels. However, it's not the fastest supercar on the block: The 2019 i8 roadster we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The i8 suffers from the same light steering that we've criticized in many current BMWs. We'd prefer more feedback, especially in a vehicle with sporting intentions. The ride is surprisingly civil and bumps in the road are felt, but never harshly.

    Interior, Comfort, and Cargo
</h5>
<p>
    <blockquote>
        <b>
            Despite the i8's focus on design versus practicality, front-seat occupants won't feel cramped. The i8 roadster has seating for only two passengers, with the folding top taking up the space that is occupied by a pair of jump seats in the coupe. Standard interior features include heated power seats and touches of leather. Cooled seats, a power-adjustable steering wheel, and passenger-seat lumbar support are not available—even as options. As you might expect, the i8 has a negligible amount of room for luggage and minimal cubby space for the trinkets of modern life. The i8's rear cargo area is long but shallow—unlike some mid-engined sports cars, there's no storage in a front trunk—and we managed to fit only a single carry-on suitcase inside.
